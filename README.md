Just and only the necessary mods to make minecraft playable. Designed to be a quick way to play a new minecraft version without having to manually download the same mods every time.
Or maybe test a mod that is crashing in an isolated environment, without messing up other instances.

_**Note: you can suggest new changes in the issues link.**_

### Designed for players that wants to:
- Play 'pure' vanilla  
- Test a new mod in an isolated environment  

### Features:
- Mostly client side optimization mods  
- No QoL mods (except for Mod Menu), you could think of it as pure vanilla  
- Don't mess up other instances with config files  
- Download boilerplate mods on a single click  

### Default configs:
- My own Mod Menu configs  
- I higly suggest using the [Shared Resources](https://modrinth.com/mod/shared-resources) mod if you want to keep your configs, worlds, texture packs (and more!) synchronized across all instances  

### Current list of mods (libraries aren't included):
- Fabric API  
- ModMenu  
- Sodium
